# ``SwiftHPKE``

## Overview

SwiftHPKE implements the Hybrid Public Key Encryption standard as defined in RFC 9180.
> Important:
SwiftHPKE requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the `Int` and `UInt` types be 64 bit types.
>
> SwiftHPKE uses Appleâ€™s CryptoKit framework. Therefore, for macOS the version must be at least 10.15,
for iOS the version must be at least 13, and for watchOS the version must be at least 8.
