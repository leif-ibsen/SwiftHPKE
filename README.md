## SwiftHPKE

SwiftHPKE implements the Hybrid Public Key Encryption standard as defined in RFC 9180
including all four modes of operation:

* Base mode
* Preshared key mode
* Authenticated mode
* Authenticated, preshared key mode

SwiftHPKE requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the `Int` and `UInt` types be 64 bit types.

Its documentation is build with the DocC tool and published on GitHub Pages at this location:

The documentation is also available in the *SwiftHPKE.doccarchive* file.
