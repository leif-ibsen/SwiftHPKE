<h2><b>SwiftHPKE</b></h2>

SwiftHPKE implements the Hybrid Public Key Encryption standard as defined in RFC 9180
including all four modes of operation:
<ul>
<li>Base mode</li>
<li>Preshared key mode</li>
<li>Authenticated mode</li>
<li>Authenticated, preshared key mode</li>
</ul>
SwiftHPKE requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the Int and UInt types be 64 bit types.

Its documentation is build with Apple's DocC tool and published on GitHub Pages at this location

https://leif-ibsen.github.io/SwiftHPKE/documentation/swifthpke

The documentation is also available in the <i>SwiftHPKE.doccarchive</i> file.
